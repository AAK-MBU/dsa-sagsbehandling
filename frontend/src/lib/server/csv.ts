// that, but Excel honours EITHER that directive OR the UTF-8 BOM, never both:
// with sep= present it ignores the BOM and falls back to the ANSI codepage,
// and "Kørselstyper" arrives as "KÃ¸rselstyper".

// A tab needs neither. Excel splits on tabs in a UTF-16 file regardless of
// locale, so the separator and the encoding stop fighting.

// UTF-16 from the FF FE byte-order mark and parses the file as text rather
// than through the locale-dependent CSV path. UTF-8 with a BOM reads the
// characters correctly too, but only under that CSV path — which is where the
// separator problem lives.
