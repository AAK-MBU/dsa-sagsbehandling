 * would resolve every browser request as an anonymous automated caller: role
 * checks would silently pass, and audit attribution would record "System"
 * instead of the person who made the change.
 *
 * The caller's Cookie header has to be forwarded in `options` for this to
 * authenticate — that cookie is the session. Only safe for requests that
 * originate from a browser with a session. There is no fallback for a call with
 * no user behind it: the frontend holds no API key of its own, deliberately, so
 * anything the backend needs to do unattended belongs on the backend.

 * Bind a server load's event to a fetch that calls the backend as its user.

 * A `+page.server.ts` load runs on the server but *on behalf of* a browser, so
 * it has a session cookie available and should use it. These loads once called
 * the backend with a shared API key instead, which made every server-rendered
 * call appear in the audit trail as an automated caller rather than the
 * caseworker — and /citizen/stamdata/{cpr} is precisely the call the trail
 * exists to attribute.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     export const load: PageServerLoad = async (event) => {
 *       const api = backendUserFetcher(event);
 *       const res = await api("/lookup/status");
 *     };
 *
 * hooks.server.ts has already rejected anonymous callers, so a load that runs
 * always has a session behind it.
