/**
 * Same-origin passthrough to the backend's OIDC endpoints (/auth/login,
 * /auth/logout, and /auth/callback where it is registered as such).
 *
 * The backend runs with root_path="/api" and expects an edge reverse proxy to
 * forward /api to it. Where that proxy exists this route never sees a request;
 * where it does not — local compose publishes the API on its own port instead —
 * this makes the same URLs work anyway. Either way the browser only ever talks
 * to the app's own origin, which is what keeps the session cookie usable.
 *
 * hooks.server.ts leaves /api/auth unguarded: these are the endpoints that
 * establish a session, so requiring one would deadlock the flow.
 *
 * Only GET is proxied — create_oidc_router() defines no other methods.

  // alongside no session. A successful login leaves it set for the rest of its
  // 60s window on purpose — clearing it on the way back through /callback would
  // disarm the very case it exists for, because the failure it detects is the
  // *backend's* Set-Cookie not reaching the browser, while this app's own
  // Set-Cookie would still arrive. Logging out is the one transition to
  // anonymous that is expected, so the marker is stale rather than diagnostic:
