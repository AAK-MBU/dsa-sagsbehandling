    Deliberately NOT behind RequireEdit. Authorship is the permission here, not
    a role: everyone may delete their own comment and nobody may delete anyone
    else's, so an edit role grants nothing extra and the lack of one takes
    nothing away. That also makes the endpoint symmetrical with the POST above,
    which has never required an edit role — a user who can write a comment can
    now withdraw it.

    This is the one mutation governed that way. Changing a case stays behind
    RequireEdit, untouched.

    Both rules live in the service: only aktivitetstype "Kommentar" may be
    deleted, so system-written history ("Sag oprettet", "Brev afsendt")
    cannot be erased by anyone, and only by the person it is attributed to. The
    endpoint is still authenticated — CurrentUser resolves through require_auth
    — and an API-key caller resolves to "System", which owns nothing.

    Addressed by aktivitet_id under its own /kommentar prefix rather than as
    /aktivitet/{aktivitet_id}: the sibling GET and POST on this router take a
    *cpr* in that position, and a CPR coerced to int would silently name a
    different row.

    Args:
        aktivitet_id:
            ID of the comment to delete.

        udfoert_af:
            Display name of the signed-in caller, compared against the
            comment's own attribution.
