"""Shared FastAPI dependencies.

This module contains reusable dependency aliases used across the API.

The main purpose is to avoid repeating dependency injection setup in every
endpoint function.

Instead of writing this in every route:

    db: Session = Depends(get_db)

we can write:

    db: DbSession

This keeps endpoint signatures cleaner and makes the code easier to update.
