"""API key security helpers.

This module contains the logic used to protect API endpoints with an API key.

The expected flow is:

1. The client sends an API key in the HTTP header:

       X-API-Key: <plain-api-key>

2. The API hashes the incoming key with SHA-256.

3. The hashed incoming key is compared against the allowed hashes stored in
   the API_KEY_HASHES environment variable.

4. If a matching hash is found, the request is allowed and the key's name is
   recorded on request.state for the audit trail.

5. If no matching hash is found, the request is rejected.

Each comma-separated entry in API_KEY_HASHES is either a bare hash or a
"<name>:<hash>" pair. Naming a key is what lets an audit row say which
automated caller acted, so prefer the named form:

    API_KEY_HASHES=os2forms:<hash>,konverteringsbot:<hash>

Important:
    The plain API keys are never stored in the application settings.
    Only hashed API keys should be stored in the environment variable.
