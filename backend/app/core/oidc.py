# OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL must use Azure B2C's path-based /tfp/ form:
#
#   https://<tenant>.b2clogin.com/tfp/<tenant>.onmicrosoft.com/<policy>/v2.0/
#       .well-known/openid-configuration
#
# NOT the ?p=<policy> query form. Both describe the same policy and return the
# same issuer, but the ?p= document advertises endpoints that already carry a
# query string, and oidc-auth builds the login URL as
# f"{authorization_endpoint}?{urlencode(params)}" — appending a second "?".
# B2C then reads the policy name as "<policy>?response_type=code", fails to
# resolve it, and answers 404 before it ever looks at our parameters.
#
# The /tfp/ document puts the policy in the path, so the endpoints have no
# query of their own and that concatenation stays well-formed.
#
# DSA: None while OIDC_ENABLED is off. OIDCConfig validates in its constructor
# and raises on an empty issuer, so building it unconditionally would crash the
# API at import until the Azure federation exists. main.py only reads it when
# OIDC is on.

    # (see app/core/session_udloeb). The IdP keeps a second one in the browser
    # with a lifetime we do not control — so without this parameter, a user
    # whose session expired overnight is redirected to the IdP, recognised
    # immediately, and sent straight back with a fresh token. A flicker, and
    # they are in. Our session resets, but nobody proved anything.
    #
    # The compliance requirement is that a user proves their identity at least
    # once a day, which is the stronger of the two readings — hence this.
    #
    # The cost is real: a full sign-in every morning rather than a redirect,
    # including MFA where it is configured. If that turns out to be too much,
    # "max_age" (seconds since the user's last real authentication) is the
    # softer alternative — it lets the IdP skip the prompt for someone who
    # already signed in that morning for something else.
