"""Technical audit trail: one row per handled HTTP call.

Written by middleware/audit_middleware.py after every business-relevant
request, in its own session with its own commit, so that a failed log write
never takes down the response it was describing.

class PortalAuditLog(Base):
    """One completed HTTP call against the API.

    Column names are PascalCase here, unlike every other model in this package,
    because the table is PascalCase in the database — the same shape as the
    PortalAuditLog in the sibling aktindsigt application. Mapping it verbatim
    keeps the two recognisably the same table.

    Every column except AuditLogId is nullable: a call can be cut short before
    its fields are known.

    Not every request reaches this table. Noise endpoints (/health, /me, the
    API docs) are never recorded, and reference-data reads under /lookup are
    recorded only when they fail — see _REFERENCE_PATH_PREFIXES in the
    middleware. So the absence of a row is not by itself evidence that a call
    did not happen.

    Attributes:
        BrugerIdent: Who made the call — the name of the API key it
            authenticated with, else the OIDC session's email claim, else the
            IdP's subject. NULL for unauthenticated calls.
        Action: The matched route's name (the endpoint function), e.g.
            "delete_bevilling". NULL when no route matched, such as a 404.
        Path: The request path. Note that several routes carry a CPR number in
            the path itself (/citizen/stamdata/{cpr}, /aktivitet/{cpr}), so
            this column holds personal data by design — knowing who looked up
            which citizen is the point of the trail.
        QueryParams: Query parameters as a JSON object, with credential-bearing
            values redacted. NULL when the call had none.
        ApiKeyId: Never written. API keys come from configuration and have no
            table to take an id from, so this stays NULL until they do.
        ApiKeyName: Name of the matched API key, for calls that used one. NULL
            for calls with an OIDC session.
        StatusCode: The response's status code; 500 when the call raised.
        DurationMs: Handling time in milliseconds, to two decimals.
        ErrorMessage: The error text, read out of the response's `detail` field
            for status 400 and up, or "type: message" for an unhandled
            exception. NULL for successful calls.
        IpAdresse: The client's IP, from X-Forwarded-For (first value), else
            X-Real-IP, else the connection's host.
        OprettetDato: When the call was logged. Stamped by SQL Server with
            SYSDATETIME() at insert, not by Python — the rest of this database
            stores local server time (see migration 002), and a UTC value here
            would sit one or two hours off every other timestamp beside it.
