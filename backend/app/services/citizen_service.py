"""Service layer for citizen-related business logic.

This module contains database operations related to citizens/students.

The service is responsible for:

- Fetching citizen stamdata
- Fetching parent/guardian data

Ported from befordringssystemet's CitizenService: the same methods, reading
the same-named views (view_Stamdata, view_ParentData). DSA: create_elev and
genberegn_skole are omitted — they belong to befordring's conversion bot and
its walking-distance calculation.

Stamdata itself is maintained by external systems and is read-only here.
